        <p>&emsp;After years of traditional patriarchy, Korean society has been shaken from its foundation. It all started with a ruthless murder of a woman at the bathroom of a karaoke bar near Gangnam subway station in 2016. The victim was a woman
          in her 20s who was ambushed by the murderer around 1:05 am. The 30-year-old man who stabbed her, Kim Sung-min, left the scene, and the victim was found at 1:25 am. Mr. Kim was arrested the next day at 10 am and admitted to murder after 6
          hours.</p>

        <p>&emsp;The reason this murder caused traction was that the murderer had no specific connection with the victim. In an interview, he claimed that he simply stabbed any woman he could find that walked into the bathroom. He also mentioned
          that he always felt looked down upon and slighted by women in general. However, the official statement from the police said that <em>"it was difficult to see the murder as a hate crime because the murderer was diagnosed of
            Schizophrenia".</em> It became a very controversial topic as some people agreed with the police statement while others did not.</p>

        <p>&emsp;The online communities and news portals turned into war-zones, and the Korean society was forced to re-examine the current status of violence against women and gender equality in general.</p>
